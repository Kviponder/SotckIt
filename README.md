# Stock It

    In this module, the objective was to develop a backend application that manages essential information for a generic E-Commerce system, such as Categories, Tags, and Products. Leveraging the power of Inquirer and MySQL databases, and with the support of the Insomnia application, I successfully implemented functionalities to create, post, and update relevant data that aligns with the requirements of customers.
